#Project Description

Avalanche Predicton is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of avalanches in a given geographical area and snow conditions. The project aims to provide accurate and reliable avalanche forecasts to support winter sports enthusiasts, mountain rescue teams, and other stakeholders in making informed decisions about backcountry travel and safety.

#Features
-Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict avalanche risk
-Incorporates various factors, such as weather conditions, snowpack data, and terrain features
-User-friendly interface to input data and generate predictions
-Continuously updated and refined to improve accuracy and reliability
